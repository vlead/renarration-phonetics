* Introduction
In this project we are building a renarration application which is
meant to take in text from a (any) web page and replace it with
phonetic equivalent symbols. The replacement need not persist. It is
just a method to allow for text to be personalized / modified for
user.

In this case we are assuming the user is a novice-reader who will
benefit by reading some text, along with some phonetic symbols.

Basic goals are:
+ create a web application with Web Services in the background
+ Inent is to be able to take a URL (any) and feed it thru our portal
  app and we get a Phonetically modified text output
+ Diff options: only selected text is modified, or whole page is
  modified etc.

The project is being developed in multiple releases: r0, r1, r2 etc.

Future aspirations for this project are:
+ change format of date (26 Jan, 2016 to January 26, 2016 or 26/1/16)
+ change unit of measure (pounds to kgs; liters to gallons; km to miles)
+ change forex ($$ to INR... based on today's rate, or based on some benchmarked date  etc)
+ Some personalization data which informs your format changes - i.e enduser has to somehow signal our system to identify which formats he likes, which date for forex etc.) so, there is some personalization tuple we need to have somewhere...
+ multiple web services... one changes date, the other change units, other changes currency... a service or a set f services get activated based on personalization tuple
+ To find date, currency, or unit... how do you search in text? - Problem area...

* requirements
** r0 requirements
This is the base release. We are planning on using this release to
setup a base system.  In this r0 we should have a server, a client and
an ability to display the text from a identified URL.

The core functions that are required of this release are:
+ develop a web app 
+ app should have a text box input for user to enter a URL
+ UI should enable the user to enter a URL
+ the web app should now be able to accept this URL and show the contents elsewhere.


** r1 requirements
In r1 we wish to introduce the concept of Web Services and Restful APi
to our code. Developing a Web Service requires the development of a
Restful API server which is different from our basic web app server
that was done in r0. So, the code in r1 will not build on r0
code. Instead, it will just use the code developed in r0.

In this r1 release we should be able to have:
*** web services functionality
**** a demo operation of modifying text
Here the input URL will give some source text. The web service will
return some dummy replacement text. This method is to just ensure that
we are able to receive and modify text
**** a demo operation to be able to replace a word with another equivalent as defined by some database
Here the attempt is to be able to search and replace text from
source. The replacement can be in a table or a database.
**** a demo of phonetic level changes to some words
Here we link to (a dummy database) full of word<->photentic symbol
mapping and we are replacing actual word with appropriate Phonetic symbol.


** r2 requirements
In this r2 release we should be able to have:
+ Change words as per the database symbols
+ Should be able to change all or part of text in source text (UI work) 


** r3 requirements

* Design
There are two applications that are simultaneously running for this
project. One is the web app which is showing the user the
phoentics. We call this the Phoentics web app. 

The other app is a Restful server. This runs independently from the
first Phonetics web app. This Restful server does not have a client
side.

In the implementation we share our coding logic for both these apps.
