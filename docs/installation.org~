Here is how you install and run the rnr_studio web application. The
instructions assume a ubutnu 14.04 operating environment. 
 1) goto a directory of your choice and clone the rnr_studio git
    repository. 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
git clone https://github.com/saigollapudi/rnr_studio.git
#+END_SRC

 2) cd to the new directory and install a Python Flask virtual
    environment. In my case, the directory is rnr_studio. The virtual
    environment is setup in a new directory called venv.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
cd rnr_studio
virtualenv venv
#+END_SRC

 3) go into the virtual environment and install all the required
    Python packages (in the virtual environment, not globally for
    python). As the installation is not needed globally, we should
    refrain from forcing the installation with "sudo". Also, use
    Python package installer "pip" for this work. In a initial bare
    virtual environment, I only had these two packages:
    "argparse==1.2.1" and "wsgiref==0.1.2". I needed to run Setup.py
    to get the first set of packages installed. README file from
    alipi repository or janastu org at github (found [[https://github.com/janastu/alip][here]]) also gives
    some basic information around this package installation requirements.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
source venv/bin/activate
python setup.py develop

#+END_SRC

 4) In the cloned directoy or rnr_studio, there are sample config
    files. They are called sampleConf.py and sampleConfig.js. These
    files need to be updated into conf.py and config.js, respectively.
